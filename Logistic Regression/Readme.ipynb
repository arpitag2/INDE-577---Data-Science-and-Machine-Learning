    "The dataset consists of red wine variant of Portuges \"Vinho Verde\" wine. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).\n",

    "For this analysis, I use a subset of the data with wine quality either 4 or 7. The reason being that the dataset is closest to linearly separable for this subset.\n",
